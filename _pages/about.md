I am Xiangjie Tang, a Computer Science undergraduate at Southeast University, passionate about developing intelligent systems that bridge the gap between cutting-edge technology and human needs. My research focuses on the intersection of Internet of Things (IoT), Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), Edge AI, and Autonomous Driving systems.

Currently, I serve as a Research Assistant at HKUST's UbiquitousX Lab, where I work on contactless vital sign monitoring and edge deployment of remote photoplethysmogram networks. Previously at Southeast University's AI-native IoT Lab, I gained extensive experience in multi-sensor fusion, particularly with mmWave radar and infrared systems, contributing to innovative human parsing solutions.

My practical engineering skills are demonstrated through my role as Vehicle Control Algorithm Engineer in the Formula Racing Team, where I've designed and implemented four-wheel independent steering systems and real-time telemetry monitoring solutions. This hands-on experience complements my academic work, allowing me to translate theoretical concepts into functional systems.

I'm passionate about creating efficient, real-time computing solutions that enhance smart environments and intelligent transportation. My work has resulted in publications in top-tier conferences, and I continue to explore how distributed intelligence at the network edge can revolutionize human-centered technologies.
