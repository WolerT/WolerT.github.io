title: "Target Liveness Detection via Mmwave Radar and Vision Fusion"
excerpt: "Gesture recognition using mmWave point clouds was achieved through deep neural networks. And the servos of the robotic arm were controlled based on the gestures.<br/><img src='/images/arm.png'>"

A feedforward neural network (FFN) was implemented on the on-board microcontroller of the millimeter-wave radar through original C code to complete the gesture recognition work. And communicate with the Raspberry Pi of the robotic arm through the UART interface, and ultimately control the rotation of the servo.
